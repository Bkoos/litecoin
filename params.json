{"name":"THCoin","tagline":"The high value cryptocurrency","body":"![THCoin logo](http://i.imgur.com/3paELmE.png)\r\n# Welcome to THCoins' page\r\nI've created this project to shed som light on the current state of cannabis research.\r\nThis means that I will donate as much as possible to research in that field.\r\nSo I've premined about 77 blocks just for this purpose. This is of course, if the coin gets any value.\r\n\r\n## Coin Specs\r\n* Scrypt\r\n* 100 coins per block\r\n* ~35M coins\r\n* 3 minute block targets\r\n* subsidy halves in 350k blocks (~2 years)\r\n* 720 blocks to retarget difficulty\r\n\r\n### Pools\r\nIf anybody wants to set up a pool, I would be grateful. As I'm only a web developer I've already had a hard time with this coin. Any help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n### Wallets\r\nWindows: [https://mega.co.nz/#!zUVWjTTK!fxZGXD5pUuL40YpyhGem64LyL7o3_CnXEGXGVdgkGac](https://mega.co.nz/#!zUVWjTTK!fxZGXD5pUuL40YpyhGem64LyL7o3_CnXEGXGVdgkGac)\r\n\r\nGNU/Linux: Coming\r\n\r\nMac OSX: Coming\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nIRC: #THCoin @ FreeNode\r\n\r\nFacebook: [https://www.facebook.com/thcoin](https://www.facebook.com/thcoin)\r\n","google":"UA-11914242-9","note":"Don't delete this file!
